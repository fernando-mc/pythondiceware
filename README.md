About Diceware
Diceware is a password creation system that forms a password using dice to select words at random from a lengthy word list. A sample Diceware wordlist contains 7776 words. So, for every truly random selection from this list the number of possible passwords (we'll call this "n") will equal 7776^n.

Diceware is a great method to use for creating a secure, yet easy to memorize, master password for accounts such as your computer, password manager, and email.
